#Sorting Algorithm Task - ALX SE
#Introduction
Welcome to the Sorting Algorithm Task for ALX Software Engineering (ALX SE)! In this task, you will implement and analyze different sorting algorithms in order to gain a deeper understanding of their efficiency and performance characteristics.

#Task Overview
The goal of this task is to implement various sorting algorithms and compare their performance in terms of time complexity, space complexity, and overall efficiency. You will be provided with a set of unsorted integer arrays that you will use to test and analyze the algorithms.

#Algorithms to Implement
You are required to implement the following sorting algorithms:

Bubble Sort
Insertion Sort
Selection Sort
Merge Sort
Quick Sort
Each algorithm should be implemented as a separate function in the programming language of your choice.

#Steps to Complete the Task
Choose a Programming Language: Select a programming language that you are comfortable with for implementing the sorting algorithms.

Implement Sorting Algorithms: Write functions to implement each of the sorting algorithms mentioned above. Ensure that they can handle different sizes of integer arrays and sort the arrays in ascending order.

Test the Algorithms: Create a test suite to validate the correctness of your sorting algorithms. Test them with various input arrays, including small, large, and edge cases.

Analyze Performance: After implementing the sorting algorithms, analyze their performance characteristics, including time complexity and space complexity. Try sorting larger arrays and measure the time taken by each algorithm. You may use libraries or built-in functions for timing measurements.

Compare the Algorithms: Write a report comparing the performance of each sorting algorithm. Include the results of your performance analysis, discussing the advantages and disadvantages of each algorithm.
